# User Management App
A React application to manage users, including viewing, adding, editing, and deleting users. This project uses the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.users.com/) for demonstration purposes

## Features
- Fetch and display users with details (ID, name, email, department).
- Add new users (simulated with API).
- Edit user details.
- Delete users.
- Error handling for API failures.

## Faced challenges 
•	Handling API Failures
•	State Management
•	Form Management: Dynamically updating form fields for both adding and editing users was challenging, especially with nested data like company.name.

## Improvements for the Future
•	Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for the user list.
•	Make the app more responsive with improved styling and media queries.
•	Replace JSONPlaceholder with a real backend to persist changes.
